<p>Computer science is a branch of engineering that deals with the scientific study of computers and their usages like computation, data processing, systems control, advanced algorithmic properties, and artificial intelligence. The study of computer science includes programming, design, analysis, and theory. Computer science engineering projects involve designing and development of various application-based software. Computer science project topics can be implemented by a number of tools such as Java, .NET, Oracle, etc. The list of computer science project ideas is as follows.
